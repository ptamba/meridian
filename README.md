# Meridian

**Autonomous Meteora DLMM liquidity management agent for Solana, powered by LLMs.**

**Links:** [Website](https://agentmeridian.xyz) | [Telegram](https://t.me/agentmeridian) | [X](https://x.com/meridian_agent)

Meridian runs continuous screening and management cycles, deploying capital into high-quality Meteora DLMM pools and closing positions based on live PnL, yield, and range data. It learns from every position it closes.

---

## What it does

- **Screens pools** — scans Meteora DLMM pools against configurable thresholds (fee/TVL ratio, organic score, holder count, mcap, bin step) and surfaces high-quality opportunities
- **Manages positions** — monitors, claims fees, and closes LP positions autonomously; decides to STAY, CLOSE, or REDEPLOY based on live data
- **Learns from performance** — studies top LPers in target pools, saves structured lessons, and evolves screening thresholds based on closed position history
- **Discord signals** — optional Discord listener watches LP Army channels for Solana token calls and queues them for screening
- **Telegram chat** — full agent chat via Telegram, plus cycle reports and OOR alerts
- **Claude Code integration** — run AI-powered screening and management directly from your terminal using Claude Code slash commands

---

## How it works

Meridian runs a **ReAct agent loop** — each cycle the LLM reasons over live data, calls tools, and acts. Two specialized agents run on independent cron schedules:

| Agent | Default interval | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Screening Agent** | Every 30 min | Pool screening — finds and deploys into the best candidate |
| **Management Agent** | Every 10 min | Position management — evaluates each open position and acts |

### Agent harness

Meridian's agent harness is the runtime wrapper around every autonomous cycle. It gives both **main** and **experimental** agents the same control loop: load live state, inject relevant memory, expose only role-appropriate tools, execute tool calls, and return a readable cycle report.

The harness also keeps a structured decision log in `decision-log.json` for deployments, closes, skips, and no-deploy outcomes. Each entry records the actor, pool or position, summary, reason, key risks, metrics, and rejected alternatives. Recent decisions are injected back into the system prompt and are available through `get_recent_decisions`, so the agent can answer "why did you deploy?", "why did you close?", or "why did you skip?" without guessing after the fact.

**Data sources:**
- `@meteora-ag/dlmm` SDK — on-chain position data, active bin, deploy/close transactions
- Meteora DLMM PnL API — position yield, fee accrual, PnL
- OKX OnchainOS — smart money signals, token risk scoring
- Pool screening API — fee/TVL ratios, volume, organic scores, holder counts
- Jupiter API — token audit, mcap, launchpad, price stats

Agents are powered via **OpenRouter** and can be swapped for any compatible model.

---

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) API key
- Solana wallet (base58 private key)
- Solana RPC endpoint ([Helius](https://helius.xyz) recommended)
- Telegram bot token (optional)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI (optional, for terminal slash commands)

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yunus-0x/meridian
cd meridian
npm install
```

### 2. Run the setup wizard

```bash
npm run setup
```

The wizard walks you through creating `.env` (API keys, wallet, RPC, Telegram) and `user-config.json` (risk preset, deploy size, thresholds, models). Takes about 2 minutes.

**Or set up manually:**

Create `.env`:

```env
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_base58_private_key
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
HELIUS_API_KEY=your_helius_key          # for wallet balance lookups
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC...        # optional — for notifications + chat
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=                       # auto-filled on first message
DRY_RUN=true                            # set false for live trading
```

> Never put your private key or API keys in `user-config.json` — use `.env` only. Both files are gitignored.

Optional encrypted `.env` flow:

```bash
cp .env .env.raw
printf "replace-with-a-long-local-key\n" > .envrypt
npm run env:encrypt
```

Meridian loads envrypt-style encrypted values automatically. Keep `.env.raw` and `.envrypt` local; both are gitignored.

Copy config and edit as needed:

```bash
cp user-config.example.json user-config.json
```

See [Config reference](#config-reference) below.

### 3. Run

```bash
npm run dev    # dry run — no on-chain transactions
npm start      # live mode
```

On startup Meridian fetches your wallet balance, open positions, and top pool candidates, then begins autonomous cycles immediately.

### Run with PM2

PM2 is supported and is the recommended way to keep Telegram control online on a VPS:

```bash
npm install
npm run pm2:start
pm2 save
```

To update an existing PM2 install:

```bash
git pull
npm install
npm run pm2:restart
```

If the process restarts repeatedly after an update, inspect the app error first:

```bash
npm run pm2:logs
```

Most post-update PM2 crashes are app startup errors, commonly from skipping `npm install` after `package-lock.json` changed, starting PM2 from the wrong directory, or missing `.env` / `user-config.json` values. Avoid `nohup`; it runs outside PM2 and can leave Telegram polling in a duplicate unmanaged process.

---

## Running modes

### Autonomous agent

```bash
npm start
```

Starts the full autonomous agent with cron-based screening + management cycles and an interactive REPL. The prompt shows a live countdown to the next cycle:

```
[manage: 8m 12s | screen: 24m 3s]
>
```

REPL commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/status` | Wallet balance and open positions |
| `/candidates` | Re-screen and display top pool candidates |
| `/learn` | Study top LPers across all current candidate pools |
| `/learn <pool_address>` | Study top LPers for a specific pool |
| `/thresholds` | Current screening thresholds and performance stats |
| `/evolve` | Trigger threshold evolution from performance data (needs 5+ closed positions) |
| `/stop` | Graceful shutdown |
| `<anything>` | Free-form chat — ask the agent anything, request actions, analyze pools |

---

### Claude Code terminal (recommended)

Install [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and use it from inside the meridian directory. Claude Code has built-in agents and slash commands that use the `meridian` CLI under the hood.

```bash
cd meridian
claude
```

#### Slash commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/screen` | Full AI screening cycle — checks Discord queue, reads config, fetches candidates, runs deep research, and deploys if a winner is found |
| `/manage` | Full AI management cycle — checks all positions, evaluates PnL, claims fees, closes OOR/losing positions |
| `/balance` | Check wallet SOL and token balances |
| `/positions` | List all open DLMM positions with range status |
| `/candidates` | Fetch and enrich top pool candidates (pool metrics + token audit + smart money) |
| `/study-pool` | Study top LPers on a specific pool |
| `/pool-ohlcv` | Fetch price/volume history for a pool |
| `/pool-compare` | Compare all Meteora DLMM pools for a token pair by APR, fee/TVL ratio, and volume |

#### Claude Code agents

Two specialized sub-agents run inside Claude Code:

**`screener`** — pool screening specialist. Invoke when you want to evaluate candidates, analyse token risk, or deploy a position. Has access to OKX smart money signals, full token audit pipeline, and all strategy logic.

**`manager`** — position management specialist. Invoke when reviewing open positions, assessing PnL, claiming fees, or closing positions.

To trigger an agent directly, just describe what you want:
```
> screen for new pools and deploy if you find something good
> review all my positions and close anything out of range
> what do you think of the SOL/BONK pool?
```

#### Loop mode

Run screening or management on a timer inside Claude Code:

```
/loop 30m /screen     # screen every 30 minutes
/loop 10m /manage     # manage every 10 minutes
```

---

### CLI (direct tool invocation)

The `meridian` CLI gives you direct access to every tool with JSON output — useful for scripting, debugging, or piping into other tools.

```bash
npm install -g .   # install globally (once)
meridian <command> [flags]
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
node cli.js <command> [flags]
```

**Positions & PnL**

```bash
meridian positions
meridian pnl <position_address>
meridian wallet-positions --wallet <addr>
```

**Screening**

```bash
meridian candidates --limit 5
meridian pool-detail --pool <addr> [--timeframe 5m]
meridian active-bin --pool <addr>
meridian search-pools --query <name_or_symbol>

```

**Token research**

```bash
meridian token-info --query <mint_or_symbol>
meridian token-holders --mint <addr> [--limit 20]
meridian token-narrative --mint <addr>
```

**Deploy & manage**

```bash
meridian deploy --pool <addr> --amount <sol> [--bins-below 69] [--bins-above 0] [--strategy bid_ask|spot|curve] [--dry-run]
meridian claim --position <addr>
meridian close --position <addr> [--skip-swap] [--dry-run]
meridian swap --from <mint> --to <mint> --amount <n> [--dry-run]
meridian add-liquidity --position <addr> --pool <addr> [--amount-x <n>] [--amount-y <n>] [--strategy spot]
meridian withdraw-liquidity --position <addr> --pool <addr> [--bps 10000]
```

**Agent cycles**

```bash
meridian screen [--dry-run] [--silent]   # one AI screening cycle
meridian manage [--dry-run] [--silent]   # one AI management cycle
meridian start [--dry-run]               # start autonomous agent with cron jobs
```

**Config**

```bash
meridian config get
meridian config set <key> <value>
```

**Learning & memory**

```bash
meridian lessons
meridian lessons add "your lesson text"
meridian performance [--limit 200]

```

**Flags**

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Skip all on-chain transactions |
| `--silent` | Suppress Telegram notifications for this run |

---

## Discord listener

The Discord listener watches configured channels (e.g. LP Army) for Solana token calls and queues them as signals for the screener agent.

### Setup

```bash
cd discord-listener
npm install
```

Add to your root `.env`:

```env
DISCORD_USER_TOKEN=your_discord_account_token   # from browser DevTools → Network
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=the_server_id
DISCORD_CHANNEL_IDS=channel1,channel2            # comma-separated
DISCORD_MIN_FEES_SOL=5                           # minimum pool fees to pass pre-check
```

> This uses a selfbot (personal account automation, not a bot token). Use responsibly.

### Run

```bash
cd discord-listener
npm start
```

Or run it in a separate terminal alongside the main agent. Signals are written to `discord-signals.json` and picked up automatically by `/screen` and `node cli.js screen`.

### Signal pipeline

Each incoming token address passes through a pre-check pipeline before being queued:
1. **Dedup** — ignores addresses seen in the last 10 minutes
2. **Blacklist** — rejects blacklisted token mints
3. **Pool resolution** — resolves the address to a Meteora DLMM pool
4. **Rug check** — checks deployer against `deployer-blacklist.json`
5. **Fees check** — rejects pools below `DISCORD_MIN_FEES_SOL`

Signals that pass all checks are queued with status `pending`. The screener picks up pending signals and processes them as priority candidates before running the normal screening cycle.

### Deployer blacklist

Add known rug/farm deployer wallet addresses to `deployer-blacklist.json`:

```json
{
  "_note": "Known farm/rug deployers — add addresses to auto-reject their pools",
  "addresses": [
    "WaLLeTaDDressHere"
  ]
}
```

---

## Telegram

### Setup

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token
2. Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token>` to your `.env`
3. Start the agent, then send any message to your bot — it auto-registers your chat ID

### Notifications

Meridian sends notifications automatically for:
- Management cycle reports (reasoning + decisions)
- Screening cycle reports (what it found, whether it deployed)
- OOR alerts when a position leaves range past `outOfRangeWaitMinutes`
- Deploy: pair, amount, position address, tx hash
- Close: pair and PnL

### Telegram commands

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/positions` | List open positions with progress bar |
| `/close <n>` | Close position by list index |
| `/set <n> <note>` | Set a note on a position |

You can also chat freely via Telegram using the same interface as the REPL.

---

## Telegram

**Setup:**

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token
2. Add `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token>` to your `.env`
3. Set the exact Telegram chat and allowed controller user IDs in `.env`

Meridian no longer auto-registers the first chat for safety. You must set:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<token>
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=<target chat id>
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS=<comma-separated Telegram user ids allowed to control the bot>
TELEGRAM_THREAD_ID=<optional — forum supergroup topic id>
```

Security notes:
- If `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` is not set, inbound Telegram control is ignored.
- If the target chat is a group/supergroup and `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is empty, inbound control is ignored.
- Notifications still go to the configured chat, but command/control is limited to the allowed user IDs.
- If `TELEGRAM_THREAD_ID` is set (forum-enabled supergroup topic id), the bot posts only into that topic and only accepts inbound messages from it. Leave blank for non-forum chats.

**Notifications sent:**
- After every management cycle: full agent report (reasoning + decisions)
- After every screening cycle: full agent report (what it found, whether it deployed)
- When a position goes out of range past `outOfRangeWaitMinutes`
- On deploy: pair, amount, position address, tx hash
- On close: pair, PnL, and the close reason (`stop loss` / `take profit` / `trailing TP` / `out of range timeout` / `low yield` / `agent decision`)
- Dry-run results are gated — no fake "Deployed/Closed" alerts when `DRY_RUN=true`

You can also chat with the agent via Telegram using the same free-form interface as the REPL: `"check wallet 7tB8..."`, `"who are the top LPers in pool ABC..."`, `"close all positions"`, etc. Only explicitly allowed Telegram user IDs can issue commands.

---

## How it learns

### Lessons

After every closed position the agent runs `studyTopLPers` on candidate pools, analyzes on-chain behavior of top performers (hold duration, entry/exit timing, win rates), and saves concrete lessons. Lessons are injected into subsequent agent cycles as part of the system context.

Add a lesson manually:
```bash
node cli.js lessons add "Never deploy into pump.fun tokens under 2h old"
```

### Threshold evolution

After 5+ positions have been closed, run:
```bash
node cli.js evolve
```

This analyzes closed position performance (win rate, avg PnL, fee yields) and automatically adjusts screening thresholds in `user-config.json`. Changes take effect immediately.

---

## HiveMind

HiveMind is **opt-in**. Telemetry sync is disabled unless you explicitly set both `hiveMindUrl` and `hiveMindApiKey` in `user-config.json` (or `HIVEMIND_API_KEY` in env). Out of the box, no telemetry leaves the machine.

To enable, point at Agent Meridian (`https://api.agentmeridian.xyz`) or your own HiveMind-compatible server.

**What you get when enabled:**
- Shared lessons from other Meridian agents
- Strategy presets and crowd performance context
- Role-aware lessons injected into future screener/manager prompts when `hiveMindPullMode` is `auto`

**What you share when enabled:**
- Lessons from `lessons.json`
- Closed-position performance events: pool, pool name, base mint, strategy, close reason, PnL, fees, and hold time
- Agent heartbeat metadata: agent ID, version, timestamp, and basic capability flags
- **Private keys and wallet balances are never sent**

HiveMind failures are non-blocking. If the server is unavailable, the agent logs a warning and keeps running.

### Enable

Set both fields in `user-config.json`:

```json
{
  "agentId": "",
  "hiveMindUrl": "https://api.agentmeridian.xyz",
  "hiveMindApiKey": "your-api-key",
  "hiveMindPullMode": "auto"
}
```

`agentId` is generated automatically on first start if blank. Set `hiveMindPullMode` to `manual` if you do not want shared lessons and presets pulled automatically.

### Disable

Leave `hiveMindUrl` and `hiveMindApiKey` blank (the default). The agent will skip every HiveMind call.

---

## Using a different LLM provider

Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works. Set the base URL, key, and model in `.env`:

**LM Studio (local)**
```env
LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1
LLM_API_KEY=lm-studio
LLM_MODEL=your-local-model-name
```

**DeepSeek (api.deepseek.com)**
```env
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com/v1
LLM_API_KEY=sk-your_deepseek_key
LLM_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash     # or deepseek-v4-pro
```
DeepSeek reasoner / thinking mode is supported — the agent detects the "thinking mode does not support tool_choice" rejection and retries without `tool_choice` for the rest of the run. No extra config needed.

**OpenAI**
```env
LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
LLM_API_KEY=sk-...
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

For per-role overrides (different model for screening vs. management), set `screeningModel`, `managementModel`, `generalModel` in `user-config.json`. Precedence: `user-config.json` > `LLM_MODEL` env > built-in default.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Telegram `Poll error: fetch failed` repeating every 5s on a cloud VM** — almost always a broken IPv6 route. Test with `curl -v https://api.telegram.org/ 2>&1 | head -20`; if you see `Immediate connect fail for 2001:...: Network is unreachable`, force the bot onto IPv4 by either:
- starting with `NODE_OPTIONS=--dns-result-order=ipv4first npm start`, or
- disabling IPv6 on the host: `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1`.

A single `fetch failed` at startup is normal — the poll loop retries every 5s. Repeated failures indicate a real network problem.

**`[OKX] advanced-info unavailable for ...`** — OKX enrichment couldn't be fetched. The bot continues with weaker risk signals. Either ignore (fine for most users) or set `OKX_API_KEY` / `OKX_SECRET_KEY` / `OKX_PASSPHRASE` / **`OKX_PROJECT_ID`** in `.env` to use the direct OKX OnchainOS path; without them the bot falls back to the Agent Meridian public relay which may rate-limit on fresh tokens. The Project ID header is required for `/api/v6/dex/market/...` endpoints — without it OKX returns 50114 "Invalid Authority" even with valid credentials.

**OKX 401 with `{"msg":"Invalid Authority","code":"50114"}`** in error body — credentials are otherwise valid but one of: (1) the key was issued from the CEX portal at www.okx.com instead of the Web3 portal at web3.okx.com → wrong scope, recreate at web3.okx.com; (2) `OKX_PROJECT_ID` env is missing → add it from the Web3 dashboard's project page; (3) the key was created under a *different* project than the Project ID you set → match them up. Verify with a hand-rolled request to `/api/v6/dex/market/token/advanced-info?chainIndex=501&tokenContractAddress=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112` (using SOL bypasses any per-token gating).

**LPAgent `HTTP 429 for owner ...`** — only happens in tight bursts before the 30-second cache absorbs them. Increase `LPAGENT_CACHE_TTL_MS` env (e.g. to 60000) if you still see them. PnL data 30–60 seconds stale doesn't affect management decisions.

**`[POSITIONS_WARN] Suspicious pnl_pct for ...`** with `diff` roughly equal to your claimed fees as % of deposit — false alarm from before the LPAgent PnL derivation included claimed fees + withdrawals. If you still see it after pulling, your bot is on an old commit; pull latest.

**`[AGENT] Empty response, retrying...`** firing repeatedly — the LLM is hitting its `max_tokens` budget on internal reasoning (common with thinking-mode models). Raise `maxTokens` in `user-config.json` from the default 4096 to 8192, or switch the affected role's model to a non-thinking variant.

**Wallet env vars don't take effect after editing `.env`** — `envcrypt.js` loads with `dotenv.config({ override: false })`, meaning pre-set shell environment variables win over `.env`. If you have e.g. `OKX_API_KEY` exported in `~/.bashrc` or a parent shell, that value will be used instead of what's in `.env`. Either unset the shell export (`unset OKX_API_KEY`) or fix the shell config.
